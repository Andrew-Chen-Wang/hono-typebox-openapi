# Contributing

Thanks for showing interest in contributing to Hono TypeBox OpenAPI ðŸ’–, you rock!

When it comes to open source, you can contribute in different ways, all of which are valuable. Here are a few guidelines that should help you prepare your contribution.

## Setup the Project

The following steps will get you up and running to contribute to Hono TypeBox OpenAPI:

1. Fork the repo (click the `Fork` button at the top right of [this page](https://github.com/Andrew-Chen-Wang/hono-typebox-openapi))

2. Clone your fork locally

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/<your_github_username>/hono-typebox-openapi.git
   cd hono-typebox-openapi
   ```

3. Set up all the dependencies and packages by running `npm install`. This command will install dependencies.

## Development

To improve our development process, weâ€™ve set up tooling and systems, and Hono TypeBox OpenAPI uses a monorepo structure.

### Commands

**`npm install`**: bootstraps the entire project, symlinks all dependencies.

**`cd apps/internal-api && npm run dev`**: runs the internal API server for testing.

## Think you found a bug?

Please follow the issue template and provide a clear path to reproduction with a code example. The best way to show a bug is by sending a CodeSandbox link.

## Proposing new or changed API?

Please provide thoughtful comments and some sample API code. Proposals that don't line up with our roadmap or don't have a thoughtful explanation will be closed.

## Making a Pull Request?

Pull requests need only the :+1: of two or more collaborators to be merged; when the PR author is a collaborator, that counts as one.

### Commit Convention

Before creating a Pull Request, ensure that your commits comply with the commit conventions used in this repository.

When you create a commit we kindly ask you to follow the convention `category(scope or module): message` in your commit message while using one of the following categories:

- `feat/feature`: all changes that introduce completely new code or new features
- `fix`: changes that fix a bug (ideally you will additionally reference an issue if present)
- `refactor`: any code-related change that is not a fix nor a feature
- `docs`: changing existing or creating new documentation (i.e. README, docs for the usage of a lib or CLI usage)
- `build`: all changes regarding the build of the software changes to dependencies, or the addition of new dependencies
- `test`: all changes regarding tests (adding new tests or changing existing ones)
- `ci`: all changes regarding the configuration of continuous integration (i.e. GitHub actions, ci system)
- `chore`: all changes to the repository that do not fit into any of the above categories

If you are interested in the detailed specification you can visit <https://www.conventionalcommits.org/> or check out the [Angular Commit Message Guidelines](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/22b96b9/CONTRIBUTING.md#-commit-message-guidelines).

### Steps to PR

1. Fork the `hono-typebox-openapi` repository and clone your fork

2. Create a new branch out of the `main` branch. We follow the convention `[type/scope]`. For example `fix/memcache` or `docs/core`. `type` can be either `docs`, `fix`, `feat`, `build`, or any other conventional commit type. `scope` is just a short id that describes the scope of work.

3. Make and commit your changes following the [commit convention](https://github.com/Andrew-Chen-Wang/hono-typebox-openapi/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit-convention). As you develop, you can run `pnpm nx build [package name]` to make sure everything works as expected.

### Tests

All commits that fix bugs or add features need a test.
